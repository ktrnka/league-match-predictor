Code for crawling Riot Games API, populating a MongoDB, and running machine learning experiments to predict who will win the games.

## Setup

* For crawling, install from requirements.txt
* For machine learning, install from requirements-ml.txt

There are two separate ones because the Heroku instance doesn't have enough space to install the full set of requirements.
